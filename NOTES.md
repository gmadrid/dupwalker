###### stuff to do

- more parallelism for image loading? 
- dup finding
  - put stuff in buckets based on number of ones in hash
  - look for images withing threshold of hamming distance
  - save these computeations to cache
- in UI, allow setting desired hamming distance to look for
- in UI, display files with close matches
- in UI, allow selection of images and show all of its neighbors
- in UI, allow deletion of selected images.
- investigate a perceptual hash like Haar.
